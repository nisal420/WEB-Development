            Kanye West held the first formal campaign event of his proposed presidential run today. The event took place
            at the Exquis Event Center in North Charleston, South Carolina.
            <br><br>
            During the event, which streamed live on ABC affiliate WPDE, West took the stage wearing a security vest with
            the number 2020 shaved on the back of his head. There were no mics at the event, and West said that anybody
            whispering would be escorted out. Near the end of the event one person was walked out by security at West’s
            request. He regularly welcomed people onto the stage to discuss their views on education, police brutality,
            and other issues. West screamed and cried at one point while discussing abortion. There’s footage from the
            event below.
            <br><br>
            The event was for registered guests only, and attendees were asked to practice social distancing, wear masks,
            and sign a COVID-19 liability release form to attend. West recently tweeted a request for supporters to help
            him get on the South Carolina ballot.
            <br><br>
            Last week, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) received two forms that could be related to Kanye West’s 2020
            presidential bid. The first form, a Statement of Organization, was filed by a committee called “Kanye 2020”
            on Wednesday, July 15. Kanye 2020 lists Kanye West as its candidate and West’s Cody, Wyoming ranch as its address.
            <br><br>
            The second form was a Statement of Candidacy, on which Kanye West is listed as the candidate. The given address
            is West’s ranch, and the political party is BDY, seemingly the abbreviation for West’s proposed Birthday Party.
            <br><br>
            An FEC spokesperson could not comment on the legitimacy of the information in the filings, but did tell
            Pitchfork, “Submission of false, erroneous, or incomplete information may subject the person signing the
            Statement to penalties of 52 U.S.C. §30109.”
            <br><br>
            In Kanye West music news: Yesterday, the rapper appeared to detail his next album DONDA in a tweet
            (viewed by Pitchfork) that he has since deleted. The 20-track LP, which he had previously announced as God’s
            Country, is slated for a July 24 release date, according to the deleted tweet. The tracklist for DONDA included
            the single “Wash Us in the Blood.”
